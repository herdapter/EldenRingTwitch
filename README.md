Elden Ring Twitch Extension
This Twitch extension enhances your Elden Ring streams by automatically tracking in-game progress and displaying it to your viewers in real time.
It works by reading and analyzing your Elden Ring cloud save file from Steam to extract key gameplay data, including:

Defeated Bosses – Viewers can see which bosses you’ve already conquered.

Discovered Map Areas – Displays the regions and map fragments you have unlocked.

The goal is to make your stream more interactive and engaging by allowing your audience to follow your journey closely without spoilers or manual updates.

While the current version focuses on bosses and map discoveries, future updates may include additional analytics and features for an even richer viewer experience.
